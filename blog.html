            <h2>Our Certificate & Online Programs For 2022</h2>
            <p>Among global companies that Hiscox ranks as experts (based on their cyber readiness model), 36% report their 
        website as the first point of entry for attackers. We’ll break down 10 common website security risks
         & 10 tips for how to secure your website without breaking the bank There are few things worse than
         sitting down to work in the morning and realizing that your website has been hacked overnight</p>
                <br>
          <p>It’s tempting to choose the cheapest hosting plan available in the market when you are facing tight budgetary constraints.
         Many business owners have the misconception that all hosting sites are equal.
        Unfortunately, that impression is far from the truth. Factors such as website security, speed, SEO, 
        and the site’s traffic-handling capacity are heavily dependent upon your hosting environment. <br>

        When you select a hosting plan, make sure you investigate what security
    measures they implement to protect their clients’ websites. Are they providing up-to-date server software,
        distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack protection, hack protection, automatic backups,
        daily malware scan, spam protection, and email protection?</p> <br>
        <p>One of the most common sources of security breaches is outdated software. Fortunately, there’s a simple fix.

     If you’re using WordPress for your eCommerce store, update all components such as WordPress software,
             plugins, themes, etc., as soon as an update is available. If it’s not a WordPress site, you’ll
              still have to keep an eye on updates. Whether it’s a web server or third-party code like Java,
               Python, Perl, WordPress, and Joomla — whenever the new version is released, 
               immediately install it on your system. <br>
            
            Updates are released for a good reason. A manufacturer’s software team often 
            releases the updated version after fixing the vulnerability of the previous versions. 
            If you don’t upgrade, hackers can easily exploit the security vulnerabilities of the old technology.</p>
